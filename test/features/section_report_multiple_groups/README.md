# Multiple Groups

Multiple parameter sets can be passed as a group and drawn into a single PDF.

- [Example code](test_feature.rb)
- [Example template file](template.tlf)
- [Example PDF](expect.pdf)

The main functions of groups are as follows:

- Page break for each group
- Headers and footers for which the "show every page" is disabled will be drawn only once per group
